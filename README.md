Welcome to Complex's Weekly Ship Blog! This is where i dive into the Star Citizen Lore, Ships, and Anything that i feel is worth discussing in the Star Citizen Universe.

May 11th was on the Corsair, While May 4th was the Drake Kraken. I intend to go down the line of ships by brand, and I will get to Anvil, Aegis and Crusader eventually.
