<h3> With a Take on Exploration and the Firepower to match it, the Drake Corsair is one of the best ships Drake Interplanetary has to offer.</h3>
<h3> Settled for 4, This Ship can get you from the Depths of ArcCorp to the Edge of The Pyro System without a hitch (Assuming you make it there in one piece).</h3>
<h3> With a Price of 6.6 Million United Earth Credits, you could take home your new ship, home, and maybe your new purpose.</h3>
